# VLAN-AND-TRUNK-PORT-CONFIGURATION
In this lab, I:
✅ Designed and documented a network topology
✅ Created multiple VLANs and assigned host devices with static IP addresses
✅ Configured switch ports for the appropriate VLAN assignments
✅ Set up trunk ports to allow inter-switch VLAN traffic
✅ Verified communication rules between devices in the same VLAN while ensuring isolation between different VLANs

This exercise sharpened my practical skills in network segmentation, device management, and switch configuration — all foundational responsibilities for a Systems Administrator. Understanding how to manage and secure network traffic through VLANs is essential for reducing broadcast domains, improving security, and optimizing network performance.

These labs not only help reinforce technical knowledge but also build confidence in troubleshooting and configuring real-world network environments.
